Stuff to do:

- Allow keyboard navigation in the settings submenu
- Decouple framerate from simulation
- Add diacritics to the fonts
- Optimize sprites
- Moar sounds
- Forced fall ragdoll
	- Do this at the end of a round
- Find proper Bohou코 jump punch
- Add sounds to the credits
- Hypertext in credits
- Quit match in pause menu
- Better random librarian graphics

Known bugs and stuff to fix:

- Victory star appears for both players when a round is drawn, though it's fixed as the next round starts
- There was that one time when my ragdoll ended up standing on its head
- Bohou코's jump frames needs to be better centred
- empty_img not actually empty
- clean-up the bike frames (redraw the wires, among other)
- Luk치코 mirror bike ride attack resolves without physics
- Bike attacks can get erratic if spammed.
