Stuff to do:

- Better random librarian graphics

Known bugs and stuff to fix:

- Players killed by fire keep their current animation
- Victory star appears for both players when a round is drawn, though it's fixed as the next round starts
- There was that one time when my ragdoll ended up standing on its head
- Bohou코's jump frames needs to be better centred
- empty_img not actually empty
- clean-up the bike frames (redraw the wires, among other)
- Luk치코 mirror bike ride attack resolves without physics
- Bike attacks can get erratic if spammed.
- Implement msg.post("@system:", "exit", {code = 0}) to exit the game. Maybe. Maybe sys.exit(0) instead.
