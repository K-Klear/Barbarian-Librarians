Animation checklist:

Stand
Walk
Walk backwards
Duck
Pain
Lie
Stand up
Victory
Turn

Jump
Jump kick
Jump punch



Stuff to do:

- Explain the movesets *somewhere*
- Basic options screen with volume and... maybe just volume for now. And see if I can make changes stick.
- Allow keyboard navigation in the main menu
- "Draw" voiceover
- Decouple framerate from simulation
- Add diacritics to the fonts
- MORE FIGHTERS!

Known bugs:

- Victory star appears for both players when a round is drawn, though it's fixed as the next round starts
- There was that one time when my ragdoll ended up standing on its head
