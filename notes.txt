Stuff to do:

- Make "round won" stars appear immediately following a knockout

- Maybe add some rudimentary sounds
- explain my moveset *somewhere*
- Basic options screen with volume and... maybe just volume for now. And see if I can make changes stick.
- Allow keyboard navigation in the main menu
- "Draw" voiceover
- "Versus" screen. Even if it means taking a selfie.
- Check if html5 slow everywhere or just on my work computer. Maybe fiddle some more with VSync settings.
- Pat myself on the back.
