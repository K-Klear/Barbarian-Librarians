Animation checklist (OLD - REWRITE!):


Stuff to do:

- Explain the movesets *somewhere*
- Allow keyboard navigation in the main menu submenus
- "Draw" voiceover
- Decouple framerate from simulation
- Add diacritics to the fonts
- Add sounds
- optimize sprites
- Pause menu
- Escape in main menu submenus

Known bugs and stuff to fix:

- Victory star appears for both players when a round is drawn, though it's fixed as the next round starts
- There was that one time when my ragdoll ended up standing on its head
- Bohouš's jump frames needs to be better centred
- empty_img not actually empty
- clean-up the bike frames (redraw the wires, among other)
- Lukáš mirror bike ride attack resolves without physics
- Lukáš punches while ducked have hitboxes in wrong position
- Bike attacks can get erratic if spammed.
