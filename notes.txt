Animation checklist (OLD - REWRITE!):

Stand
Walk
Walk backwards
Duck
Pain
Lie
Stand up
Victory
Turn

Jump
Jump kick
Jump punch



Stuff to do:

- Explain the movesets *somewhere*
- Allow keyboard navigation in the main menu submenus
- "Draw" voiceover
- Decouple framerate from simulation
- Add diacritics to the fonts
- Add sounds
- optimize sprites

Known bugs and stuff to fix:

- Victory star appears for both players when a round is drawn, though it's fixed as the next round starts
- There was that one time when my ragdoll ended up standing on its head
- Bohou≈°'s jump frames needs to be better centred
- empty_img not actually empty
- clean-up the bike frames (redraw the wires, among other)
